This project will be a classic implementation of a [MultiLayer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) (MLP).

The learning material I used for this project is [neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) and the [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) Youtube channel.

I also have some notes I have taken in the notes direcotry of this project that helped me understand some of the material!

Training data is available [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/archive/master.zip).
