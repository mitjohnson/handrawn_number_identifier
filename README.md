# Handrawn Number Identifier

This project aims to experiment with a [MultiLayer Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) (MLP) with the goal of developing a better undestanding of machine learning.

I have made some notes while working through the material in the [notes directory](https://github.com/mitjohnson/handrawn_number_identifier/tree/master/notes).

Learning material used:
 >[neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html)
 >[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown) Youtube channel.

Training data is available [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/archive/master.zip).
